<h3>A2Z Hiring</h3>

<h6>
A2Z Hiring is an intelligent, quick and easy hiring portal. It has three components: Candidate, Hiring Manager and Subject Matter Experts.

Process of hiring:
  * Candidate uploads his resume that will be passed to an pdf processing model from a 3rd party API and that will return a summary of the pdf which then can be saved to database and be used to apply in multiple positions.
  * Hiring Manager can upload job roles with all the details for the requirement and one or more prominent subjects required for the role.
  * Then a Subject Matter Expert(SME) comes into the picture and will look over the job role carefully consider the subject and then interview the candidate online.
  * The interview also will be hosted on our website where we integrate zoom calls and record the interview sessions.
  * Then the recorded session will be passed to a video processing and analysis model, which will be used to show the hiring manager as a jist of the interview taken by the SME, and then finally the Hiring Manager can also use the video and it's summary to hire a candidate.
